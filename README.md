This is a Discord bot that I am developing and slowly updating as changes are requested for the Pine Valley Railway Discord for the #hfi_log channel to help automate and standardize incident reports across its Railroader game server.

The bots up time can be viewed here: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/aqAscRbN4N
As well you can check with the bot directly here: https://discord-hfi-log-bot.onrender.com/
