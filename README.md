This is a Discord bot that I am developing and slowly updating as changes are requested for the Pine Valley Railway Discord for the #hfi_log channel to help automate and standardize incident reports across its Railroader game server.

How to check if this bot is online?
1. Via the bots uptime status page which can be viewed here: https://stats.uptimerobot.com/aqAscRbN4N <br>
2. As well as with the bot directly here: https://discord-hfi-log-bot.onrender.com/
